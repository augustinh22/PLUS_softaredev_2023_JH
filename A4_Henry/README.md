# A4 Overview

I aimed to create 3 functions using folium to aid in map visualization. The three functions are as follows:
1. Create Map - Map creation with user-defined inputs
2. Draw Polygon - Allow the user to draw a polygon on the map to be used in further analysis
3. Add Shapefile to Map - Allow the user to add a shapefile to the map for further analysis.

However, things did not go as smoothly as planned.

## Challenges
I have documented my challenges in the Jupyter notebooks included. I had a test space notebook where I tested the functions and a second notebook where I called the functions from the Python script. I also uploaded 2 Python scripts as I restarted the process of making the function but I still encountered the same challenges with draw control and adding a shapefile.

In summary, I believe the main challenge that affected the functionality of the functions is the use of the same map in the 3 functions. I think I made a mistake somewhere along the way but I am not sure.
I look forward to your feedback to help me potentially resolve these issues and improve my skills.
